### Hi, I'm Ethan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Scottdale, Arizona. I have a passion for music, travel, and all things financial. I'm proficient in JavaScript, PostgreSQL, React, CSS, HTML5, but have experience and exposure in Python, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Redux, Express & Pug. 

## Fun Fact:

Outside of software engineering, I'm also an audio engineer! This was part of the reason why I ventured into becoming a software engineer. ðŸ˜„ 

## I'm currently looking to:

Find an incredible company that will help me continue to learn and provide mentorship to become the best software engineer I can be! 

## Before Engineering...

I was an entrepreneur in the tech space and graduated with a degree in Finance. 

## Most Recent Project Software Stack:

SQLAlchemy/Flask/Python Backend, React/JavaScript Frontend => https://github.com/ethanswe/Crypto-Club
