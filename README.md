### Hello World, I'm Ethan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Scottdale, Arizona. I have a passion for music, mentorship, travel, disruptive technology, and all things finance. 
## Fun Fact...

Outside of software engineering, I'm an audio engineer! I also have been trading cryptocurrency for 6 years and love learning about new disruptive ICO's. ðŸ˜„ 

## Before Engineering...

I was an entrepreneur in the tech space and graduated with a degree in Finance. I also had the opportunity to study at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and won a case competition as one of the youngest students in the program.
